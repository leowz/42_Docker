# Docker - @42Born2Code

Docker is the project @42Born2Code which give us a guide to the world of networking and docker.

There are two individual projects involved.

The project 'init' is about basic networking knowledges.

The project 'docker-1' is about the basic usage of the docker software.

Those two projects are different as they are done in form of questions and answers, instead of making proper programs.
